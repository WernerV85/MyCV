                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>
                            My GIS journey started back in 2011 when I joined PWC Combined Systems as a GIS
                            Technician. After University I struggled to find a job in my field of study (Geography
                            and Environmental Management) and got the position by chance after contacting a contact
                            through church who knew someone working at PWC Combined Systems. I picked up a lot of GIS
                            skills on the job.
                            <br/>
                            
                            <br/>
                            In the beginning of 2014, I was contact by a family member enquiring if I would be open to 
                            go to work in shorts, as a joke as I seldom wear trousers. My response was "Where do I sent my CV?".
                            This led to me joining IMQS Software in mid-2014 as a Senior GIS Support Agent. I had to prove my worth at
                            IMQS and I worked hard, as I was the only GIS person in the Johannesburg office, and really in the whole Company.
                            I set up all the GIS processes from scratch, and I started building the GIS department.
                            <br/>
                            
                            <br/>
                            The year 2025 held a lot of changes for me, professionally and personally. I relocated my family to Cape Town,
                            from Gauteng, to be closer to the office in Stellenbosch and to pursue the development side of GIS. Started the 
                            Software Engineering course through Stellenbosch University and HyperionDev, however 3 months in, I had a stroke.
                            I had to pause the course for 2 months to recover, and started back in September 2025. Since the stroke I have not
                            had time to do my recreational activity, bank fishing, as I am not yet stable on my feet and all my focus is on completing
                            the Software Engineering course.
